## issues

- dnd
  - simple approach loses context due to stepping out of react tree to run a ReactDOM.render().
    - Would need to pass drag parts as props (no context)
    - Or do the entire tree render in react - like a simple slate
  - HTML5Backend - ? going to be a an issue w/ multiple items using dnd?

* hey diddle sample
* add feedback
* check perf
* more complex html
